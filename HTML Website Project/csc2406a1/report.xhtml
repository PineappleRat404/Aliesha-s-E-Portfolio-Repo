                    <br />
                    <p>This is a good design because many of the style choices made have been closely modelled from active federal government websites.
                        It has been designed to be scanned easily by users, and links have been provided at the top and bottom of each page. Accessibility 
                        has been considered within the design through the inclusion of large thumbnail images that users can enlarge by clicking on them. 
                        All efforts have been made to lay out all pages to make them easy to navigate for all users and uses simplified language to be as 
                        inclusive as possible.</p> 
                    <p>All pages have been designed so that they are responsive on smaller screens. This has been tested on a range of screen sizes, and 
                        confirmed to be working as expected. The site has also been designed with a responsive navigation menu. The menu will display on 
                        desktop screens across the top of the page, whereas this reverts to a sandwich menu when viewed on a smaller screen. 
                    </p>

                <h2>Why adopt this design?</h2>
                <div class="body-notes">
                <p>The department should consider adopting this design, because it was created with the user in mind, first and foremost. As a user myself, 
                    I designed the site in a way that I would like to navigate it. Keeping the site informative, but "clutter free" was a major focus of the 
                    overall design. The site is meant to be quite minimal in terms of imagery and colour, as its overall purpose is to provide a user with 
                    information, not to be a marketing site. I believe these points have been achieved in the design that has been presented. I welcome 
                    any and all feedback on how the site design can be improved for implementation. PLEASE NOTE: No images were created through AI. All sources
                    used for images are listed in the references section below.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>What issues did I face?</h2>
                <div class="body-notes">
                <p>Mostly, I feel that I was able to overcome my most difficult challenges when creating this site, though there are some features of 
                    it that I feel could do with further refinement. These have been listed below: </p>
                    <ul class="lists">
                        <li><strong>Images: </strong>While I have included images as a thumbnail that can be expanded to a larger size, I'm not entirely 
                        pleased with their implementation as they are. Good design principles dictate that I should not just re-size the thumbnail and larger 
                        images, but to be sure I was able to include accessible images for the design, both sets of images have been re-sized to suit their 
                        respective purposes.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li><strong>Scrolling banner: </strong>I am happy with the banner I have included on the homepage, but it was very difficult to get working 
                        correctly! It was adapted from another website, which meant that I had to make a lot of adjustments to see what would work. Without time 
                        contraints, I would like to refine the design of the banner, and how it cycles through the images. The aspect ratio is quite narrow, and 
                        the images included are cut off in places, but I have tried re-sizing them to make them fit better into the banner. The last image also gets
                        cut off quite abruptly at the end of the cycle, which I have not been able to fix.</li>
                        <li><strong>Search functionality: </strong>I have included a search bar at the top of each page, but I have not been able to make this functional. 
                        I have not been able to figure out to make this functional through the use of only html and css as all information on this I have been able to find
                        relates only to search functionality using JavaScript. I have decided to keep it as a placeholder to show what this will look like on the page should 
                        the department approve this design.</li>
                    </ul>
