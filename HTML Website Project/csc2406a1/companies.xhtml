                <h2>John Deere</h2>
                <p>John Deere is an industry leader in agricultural machinery. As a company, they have made great strides in the development of 
                    self-driving machines and smart technologies that have largely automated the most manual aspects of agricultural labour. To 
                    create a more sustainable future, our department works closely with industry leaders like John Deere to promote the development 
                    of E-transport that is zero-emission and better for the planet. As we now know, the agricultural industry is a major contributor to 
                    global emissions and we are proud to work with a business striving to reduce these.</p>
                <p>John Deere has produced a range of E-vehicles for domestic and commercial use:</p>

                <p>The Australian lifestyle demands a range of domestic vehicles that have zero emissions but can also provide the same level of performance 
                    and convenience that we are accustomed to. Eco Boats is an Australian company that manufactures E-transport designed for use in our oceans and 
                    local waterways. They have developed a range of boats and electic motors that provide a safer and emission-free mode of transport. This means
                    that new watercraft create less pollution and existing boats can be retro-fitted to be more environmentally conscious.</p>
